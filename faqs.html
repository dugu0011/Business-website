    </div>
    <div class="accordion-item-body">
      <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
        At The Cobbler & Co. we have an expert team of color matching experts! We assure you, that the original color of your product will remain intact! However, in case of certain leather restoration, the color can become a tone lighter & the touch and the feel may become slightly rough/coarse! Also, if a Suede handbag or shoe is dirty, then generic cleaning does not help. So, we need to dye the product in a darker color to camouflage the stains! Suede leather also sometimes tends to become a tone lighter, after generic cleaning! At times, the inside lining/fabric of handbags also tends to become rough and coarse after cleaning! Either which way, we inform you about these matters beforehand!
